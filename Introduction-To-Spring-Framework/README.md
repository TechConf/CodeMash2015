CodeMash 2015   ![CodeMash Logo](https://doorcomp.blob.core.windows.net/doorcomp/Codemash%20Gearhead%20200.png)
============

This presentation was a basic introduction to Spring Framework and does cover some of the earlier XML based configurations (prior to 4.0) and includes more modern annotations up to 4.1.   The examples progress from simple pojo dependency management to more loosely coupled examples.  The last two projects presented included the use of the JDBC template and JTA Transactional processing.  Finally there was a demo of the Spring Boot.

The code is inside the CodeMash2015-IntroToSpringFramework.zip file.  The slides are available as i2sf_slides.ppt, i2sf_slides.pptx, or is2sf_slides.pdf.

If have questions or would like more information about Spring Framework feel free to contact me, David Lucas, at
