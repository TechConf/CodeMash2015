Wonder what all the Cloud Computing hype is about? Want to know how to deploy a standard Java web application to the cloud and get limitless scalability? Well, this hands on tutorial will answer all your questions and provide confidence by walking you through the process of deploying a sophisticated Java web application to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) Cloud. During this tutorial you will provision clustered servers (EC2), relational database (EC2 and EBS), load balancer (Elastic Load Balancing), content delivery (Cloud Front) and how to monitor your whole infrastructure. Other Amazon Web Services will be demonstrated and discussed as appropriate. Note: An Amazon Web Services Account is a nice to have and will incur a minimal cost during the tutorial but is not a requirement. Access to AWS will be provided to you if you donâ€™t already have access.
